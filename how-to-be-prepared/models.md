# 2. Enable the right models for the job

Amplified developers need to have the freedom to use and reuse the right models and components to automate tasks in their job.

**Actions to take now**

- Set up a proxy server to make LLMs available to developers
- Make multiple models available and compare their usage
- Provide explicit guidance on how developers can test models locally
- Ask developers to share about how they are using your AI dev system

Situations and environments vary so much that developers are going to need figure out how to balance speed, quality, cost, and other constraints when automating part of their job. To do this, they need to be able to know about the models they are using and have choice over when, where, and how to use them.

The state-of-the-art is moving so fast that even models released six months ago can be outdated, so you donâ€™t want to be locked into any particular vendor. You want to be able to constantly swap out and try different models. Empowering developers in this way will set them to use the specific model best suited to each task (e.g. autocomplete, chat, re-rank, embed, etc).
