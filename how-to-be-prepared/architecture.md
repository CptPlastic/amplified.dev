# 1. Establish a modular, architecture of participation

Amplified developers need to not only use AI software development systems but also be actively involved in their improvement too.

**Actions to take now**

- Commit to amplifying instead of automating developers and tell your team
- Ensure your AI dev system is modular and designed for user contribution
- Set up a sustainable way to configure and roll out updates to your team
- Make it easy to share prompts, context providers, slash commands, etc.

Like DevOps, this is a practice that requires the whole team. You need to make sure to design your AI software development system with an [architecture of participation](https://web.archive.org/web/20120208001626/http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/articles/architecture_of_participation.html) in mind. When anyone on your team gets a wrong / bad suggestion from the system, they should be able to do something about it. This is critical because these systems are so often wrong today.

But this is only possible if each developer has the opportunity and ability to participate in the creation and maintenance of the system. If this true, then over time, the system will increasingly help construct and maintain the software you create within your organization, while the developers who previously did that work shift more time to working on the system itself.
