# 5. Adopt open-source interfaces

Amplified developers need standardized interfaces (i.e. IDE extensions today), so that an open an ecosystem can emerge within and across organizations.

**Actions to take now**

- Educate developers on your team about development data
- Push for other organizations to also standardize on the same interfaces
- Roll out open-source interfaces like Continue to your team

At Continue, we are working with organizations to ensure that the interface between developers and AI is [open source](https://github.com/continuedev/continue). This enables all of us to 1) build an open ecosystem of components decoupled from the interface and 2) ensure that data emitted by the interface, which will be used to make increasingly capable models for software development, is pooled and directed by its owners rather than being collected and monopolized by a centralized, closed-source interface.

Today, this interface is a VS Code + JetBrains extension that includes a GUI, prompts, basic retrieval systems, configuration, and abstractions that allow you to plug in other components (e.g. your own RAG system). Much like Docker, Linux, and Git, [the interface between developers and AI is so critical that is will ultimately be public infrastructure](https://blog.continue.dev/initial-fundraise/).
