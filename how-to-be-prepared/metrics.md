# 3. Measure and improve system metrics

If we want developers to be amplified, they need to understand how the AI software development system works and know if changes they make to it lead to better outcomes or not.

**Actions to take now**

- Collect development data when developers use LLMs
- Determine what KPIs are worth tracking for your team
- Set up dashboards that show your system usage
- Identify opportunities for improvement from the data
- Make changes to the components to improve KPIs

Your system will likely not be the best when you first stand it up, but if you collect data, you will set yourself up to improve it over time. You’ll also be able to show the value / ROI / positive impact on productivity. This will set you up to get more budget and resources from your organization for future system investments.

When you use LLMs while coding, you create development data that shows the step-by-step process a developer takes to complete a task, the context a developer uses to decide what to do at each step, and natural language that explains the reasoning behind the steps. It’s data on how you build software—the stuff that happens in between Git commits, which is created as a by-product of using LLMs while coding.

If vendors collect your data without at least giving you access to it, they are likely not a good fit. AI models are as good at coding as they are because developers made their code publicly available on GitHub, and you being able to keep your development data is going to be critical for your ability to understand and improve your AI software development system in the future.

The reason this is necessary is because each of us has our own definition of the right way to build software. To gain mass adoption, the AI systems that we use to build software need to not only respect this but also reflect it. When suggestions we get from AI systems do not meet [our definition of the right way to build software](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/copilot), we need to be able to [improve them](https://blog.continue.dev/improve-code-suggestions/).
